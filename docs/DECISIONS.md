# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001 — Single process, single binary (2026-09-16)
Accepted. A Riot key's rate limit bounds throughput; multiple processes only add coordination. See docs/design/03.

## ADR-002 — SQLite (WAL) as the only default store (2026-09-16)
Accepted. Postgres behind a feature flag for > ~50 GB archives. See docs/design/02, 04.

## ADR-003 — Rust / axum / tokio (2026-09-16)
Accepted. Go was the runner-up. See docs/design/02.

## ADR-004 — rusqlite (bundled) over sqlx (2026-09-23)
Accepted. The design already routes every query through one writer thread plus a reader pool (docs/design/03 §Cross-cutting decisions, 04 §SQLite configuration). That model is synchronous by nature, so rusqlite fits it without an async driver layered on top. `bundled` compiles SQLite into the binary, which the static musl build and the `FROM scratch` image need (07 §Option A). sqlx's compile-time query checking needs a live database or checked-in query metadata at build time. For a schema this small that costs more than it catches, and table-driven tests against a tempfile database cover the same ground.

## ADR-005 — refinery for migrations; rusqlite held at 0.39 (2026-09-23)
Accepted. refinery embeds `NNNN_*.sql` files with `embed_migrations!`, applies them on boot, and records applied versions in its own history table. That matches 04 §Schema ("Migrations are embedded in the binary … and applied on boot") and keeps migrations as plain SQL files that can be diffed against the v1 schema.
Consequence: refinery 0.9.2 accepts `rusqlite >=0.23, <=0.39`, but the latest rusqlite at the time of writing is 0.40. rusqlite is therefore held at 0.39. Only one `libsqlite3-sys` may be linked, so the two crates cannot use different versions. Revisit when refinery widens its range. `rusqlite_migration` 2.6 (which supports 0.40) is the fallback if refinery stalls.

## ADR-006 — CI required checks and toolchain pin (2026-09-23)
Accepted (owner decision on the checks and on deferring docker).
- Branch protection on `main` requires the four job checks `fmt`, `clippy`, `test` and `build-musl`, with `strict` (the branch must be up to date). The plan's §1 said to require `ci`, but GitHub reports status checks per job, never per workflow, so a required `ci` check would never arrive. Job ids must stay stable; renaming one means updating branch protection too.
- `build-musl` builds the static binary and asserts it is statically linked and under 20 MB (P0 exit check). The docker build and `healthcheck` steps from §4.4 are added in P0-07, when the Dockerfile exists.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pins `1.98.1` (current stable on 2026-09-23). CI installs the toolchain from that file with `rustup toolchain install` instead of `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`, so the version is set in exactly one place.
- The repo is public (owner decision), so branch protection works on the free plan.

## ADR-007 — reqwest 0.13 TLS features; embedded roots via `tls_certs_only` (2026-09-23)
Accepted. docs/design/09 lists `reqwest` with `rustls-tls`, and 07 §The artefact says "rustls + webpki-roots so there is not even a CA bundle to mount". reqwest 0.13 renamed `rustls-tls` to `rustls` (aws-lc-rs provider plus `rustls-platform-verifier`) and removed the `rustls-tls-webpki-roots` feature. On its own, the platform verifier would read the system CA store, which is empty in a `FROM scratch` image.
Decision: enable `rustls`, and in P1-03 build the client with `ClientBuilder::tls_certs_only(<webpki roots>)`. reqwest 0.13 bypasses the platform verifier when `tls_certs_only` is set (it uses `with_root_certificates` directly), so the binary carries its own roots as the design intends. P1-03 adds the roots crate and a test that the client builds with no system store.

## ADR-008 — Config layering and interpretation choices (2026-09-23)
Accepted.
- **Layering.** figment merges three string maps (`.env` < process env < CLI flags, over built-in defaults). A typed pass in `src/config.rs` then parses and validates the result, reporting every bad variable at once like v1's `parseEnv`. figment's `Env` provider is not used: it parses `"12345678"` into a number, and a number then fails to deserialize into a `String` field (`RIOT_API_KEY`, `HOST`). Its `Serialized` string maps also refuse to coerce `"8080"` into `u16`, so figment can only do the merging, not the typing. Only variables in `config::VARS` are read, so unrelated process env vars are ignored. Empty values count as absent (v1 behaviour).
- **`NODE_ENV` fallback.** design/07 says `ENV` replaces `NODE_ENV`. If `ENV` is unset and `NODE_ENV` is set, `NODE_ENV` is used. Otherwise a v1 `.env` with `NODE_ENV=production` would boot as development, re-enabling `AUTH_DISABLED` and the dev UI. `ENV` wins when both are set.
- **`DEV_UI`** keeps v1 semantics: unset means on everywhere except production, and an explicit value wins even in production. design/07's "production … turns `DEV_UI` off" is read as the default, which is how v1 behaves.
- **`DDRAGON_DIR`** defaults to `$DATA_DIR/ddragon` ("now derived", design/07). It is still honoured when set, so v1 `.env` files port unchanged.
- **`RIOT_USER_AGENT`** defaults to `riot-proxy/2.0 (+https://github.com/NinjaGoldfinch/riot-proxy)`. design/07 elides the URL (`riot-proxy/2.0 (+…)`).
- **Numeric bounds** are v1's TypeBox bounds verbatim. The one new numeric, `JOB_CONCURRENCY`, only requires ≥ 1.
- **Deferred validation.** `DEFAULT_PLATFORM`, `LADDER_PLATFORMS`, `LADDER_QUEUES`, `LADDER_TIER_FLOOR` and `CACHE_TTL_OVERRIDES` are kept as strings here. They are validated against the Riot enums by the modules that own them (P1-01, P1-02, P7-02) so config does not re-declare Riot semantics. v1 validated them at boot, and v2 will too once those modules exist.
- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…` and `ROLE=api|worker` are refused until the `postgres` feature exists (P8-04).
